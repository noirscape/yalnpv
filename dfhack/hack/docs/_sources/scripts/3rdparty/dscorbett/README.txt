An incredibly detailed simulator and random generator for natural languages.

.. warning::

    This script is unfinished.  Make backups before changing your raws!

While incomplete, it already supports a range of features such as composition
of words from phonemes, loanwords, mispronunciation if a unit is not fluent
in the language, the effects of historical events on language, and much more.

Usage:

:start:     Start the script
:stop:      Stop the script
:test:      Runs some (verbose) tests

Undocumented features include saving translation tables, testing the script,
overwriting the language raws with generated languages, and so on.
